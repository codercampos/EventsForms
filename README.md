## Supported Platforms
* iOS
* Android (coming soon)

## Objective
This is a simple task to replicate the Events for Facebook app and show some of my work (this means that is for educational/portfolio purposes). You are free to download/fork/replicate this repository for any purpose you want (also feedback is well recieved).

I will be adding some cool stuff that Xamarin Forms does not have directly on its API (like the Search bar on the NavigationBar)(I have to figure it out how this works) and document any difficulties here to let you know some approach you might have on your own apps.
